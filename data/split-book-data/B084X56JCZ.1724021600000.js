Further, the mystery of blank spots in her memories raises more questions for the goddess. Fortunately, she is not alone in her journey.</p> <p>The mortals followers of Tyria’s faith find themselves embroiled in a war with roots far in the past, and which may have consequences for the future as well. A single tug at Fate’s tangled skein could have consequences that none of them anticipated, not even Tyria’s hidden enemies.</p>";
