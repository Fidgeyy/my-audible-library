window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>A run-of-the-mill hero meets his match in the form of a dungeon that's not what it seems in this adventurous fantasy romance for fans of isekai LitRPG.</b></p> <p>Kelsey never imagined she'd be transported to a different world and reborn as a sentient dungeon. And it's not like her disembodied soul had much choice in the matter . . .</p> <p>Being a small dungeon on the outskirts of town in the backwaters of an unimportant kingdom isn't easy, but Kelsey's done her best to level up and become the best dungeon she can be: Digging a hole of ever-increasing depth and complexity. Creating an undead atmosphere that would make a necromancer proud. Spawning monsters and treasure. Killing adventurers. But lately, things have gotten a bit stale.</p> <p>When a hottie of an adventurer staggers into her cave, Kelsey decides to grab life by the throat. With a newly formed avatar and a deal that makes things very difficult for her heroic new companion, this dungeon is going to do exactly what <i>she</i> wants for the first time in, well, forever— <i>and</i> have the best time doing it.</p> <p><b>From the author of Phantasm: The first volume of the hit LitRPG fantasy series—originally released on Royal Road—now available on Kindle, Kindle Unlimited, and Audible!</b></p>";
