window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Hannah has a routine. Wake up, take a shower, go to school, go to work, come home, and pass out.</b></p> <p>It's a perfectly normal routine for a perfectly normal girl who does not have to remember how her limbs work every morning because of haunting nightmares of being a very different creature in a very different world. That's all she thinks they are—nightmares—until one night, they're all too lucid, and her body on Earth starts to change. Slowly, Hannah's humanity starts to slip away... but surely she can continue just sticking to the routine, right? It'll be fine. It has to be.</p> <p>A mix of urban and traditional fantasy, <i>Bioshifter</i> is a story in two worlds, with magic leaking in from one to the other. It's a story about love, self-acceptance, neurodivergence, and a whole lot of trauma. Strap in and enjoy!</p>";
