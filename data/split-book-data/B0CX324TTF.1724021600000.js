window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Devour. Break through your limits. Overcome adversity. Survive.</p> <p>Evelyn has advanced leaps and bounds beyond anyone in the Crowned Islands, but in the world outside, she's still near the bottom of the food chain-a mere Category 0 in a world where the monstrous Titans outclass her ten-thousandfold. And unfortunately for her, it seems as if there are even more people out here who want her dead.</p> <p>Alongside her new partners, she'll explore the wider world from subterranean kingdom to laboratories hosted in anomalous fragments and face off against creatures who could crush her with a thought. Evelyn refuses to bend; she will shatter her limits-and everyone in her way-or die trying.</p> <p>All the while, Sapphire Clearwater's machinations continue. Nobody knows the half-elf's plans, least of all Evelyn, but she knows that she refuses to be a puppet dancing on someone else's strings.</p> <p>The wider world brings danger. But it also brings so much more to Devour.</p>";
