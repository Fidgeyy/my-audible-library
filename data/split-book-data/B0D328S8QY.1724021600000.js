And if you're a newcomer, buckle up for an unforgettable rollercoaster ride.</p> <p>Born one of the Powered in a world starving for superhuman defenders, Boyd is both blessed and cursed—blessed in that he was born Powered, possessing superpowers on a world in desperate need of each Hero able to defend humanity from a hostile planet, but cursed in that he is one of the Changed. The Changed are those Powered who were transformed into creatures from long-dead Old Earth’s myths and legends. Changed have the unfortunate tendency to behave exactly as they appear. So when the young Boyd, who had always aspired to be a Hero, Changed into a demon during puberty, his aspirations turned to dust. Despite what seemed like an insurmountable challenge, he was shaken but remained unbroken.</p> <p>Even as his dreams of heroism seem crushed, Boyd clings to hope, resilient in the face of adversity.

Love's initial spark reveals a startling truth – he's an Enhancer, wielding a power that demands a heavy toll. Grappling with a mentor's spiteful influence, Boyd finds his path strewn with insurmountable challenges. Faced with the impossible, he must confront the monstrous demands thrust upon him, even if it means breaking the promises he once held sacred. Can Boyd reconcile his newfound mission with his unwavering principles, or will the clash lead to a transformation he can't escape?</p>";
