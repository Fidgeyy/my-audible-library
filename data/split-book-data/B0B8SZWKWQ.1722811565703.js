window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>[I was reborn too weak to become an adventurer, so I opened an item shop by the dungeon instead!] [Book 3]</b></p> <p>Having been forced to abandon their home in the cold, western mountains, Fresh and her friends make a bid to move across the nation in their desperate search for a place where they can live in peace together. This drives them towards the distant east, to the dry, harsh desert and the ocean city—the nation’s most thriving port of call.</p> <p>Once more, they are forced to reopen the Dungeon Item Shop, learning from the lessons of the past and learning to live with one another as a very unusual yet functional family. Between the brand new dungeon, the city in the desert, and a familiar face from the past, all of which present new dangers, a real threat slowly festers, bubbling to the surface as the patron entity that has granted Fresh her powers as a witch begins to finally make its moves, its rationale and desires coming to the forefront and placing all of their lives in terrible danger.</p> <p>Fresh, determined to do whatever she can to keep her new way of life safe from anyone and anything that would threaten it, dives deeply into her obsessions as she works day and night to manage not only her and her friends' new life together as a family but to find a way out of this situation that she has brought them into for all of them—together. The true hero arrives in the world in the central city, predestined to destroy her and everything she holds dear to her heart.</p> <p>Life may yet seem more peaceful than ever on the surface now that they’re far away from the troubles of the past and living near the sunny ocean, but is there ever really an escape when they themselves carry the true problem of their situation within themselves or when the past seems closer than one thinks—living just down the street in the local adventurers’ guild?</p> <p>Find out in this wholesome, dark fantasy adventure written by renowned and trending author D.M. Rhodes!</p>";
