Either way, Regan is determined to cause as much chaos as he can, and with him creating plenty of toys and taking some from others, he is very much capable of annoying more than a few people.</p> <p>Louella, on the other hand, finds her hands full with the tournament for Marquis Valamar. More than adventurers want to take part causing more than a few issues. She might be able to deal with it if her mind was suddenly being occupied by thoughts of Earle all the time.
