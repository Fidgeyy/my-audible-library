From a shakedown run to find a fellow Earther, to Iona's new kitsune [Squire] Nina, to a whole new set of skills and abilities from [Loremaster], Elaine is busy. Her name is starting to be known on the world stage, whether she likes it or not.</p> <p>Through all that, Elaine is informed that the Sixth Legion is going to be deployed to the Han Empire, to put their thumb on the scale in the great civil war, with each of the factions claiming the Mandate of Heaven has fallen on their shoulders. From the thousands of men and women of the Sixth, engaged in deadly battle, to a low-level and vulnerable [Squire], Elaine has to shield and protect her allies and prevent them from coming to harm. As an Immortal, she's not supposed to interfere in mortal affairs. If the deadly Wardens catch wind of her, a swift execution is the best she can hope for.</p> <p>The bigger question looms, her sacred [Oath] demanding a responseâ€”When does she heal her enemies?</p>";
