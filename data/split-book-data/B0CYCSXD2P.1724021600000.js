Although a detour they hadn’t planned, it was now time for a young dragon to adapt to the expansive world of Peolynca outside her birthplace.</p> <p>Not only to its social customs, laws, and culture, but also to the growing number of eyes belonging to more than just monsters. The strong will attract the strong like a magnet, while the opportunists will look at this budding girl with interest.</p> <p>Meanwhile, in the heavens, the fire god, Danterno, gazes down from his fiery throne, his eyes locked onto this growing flame in defiance of his fellow deities.</p> <p>All these events cannot compare to the emotional turmoil haunting Hestia as she strikes out on her debut. A coming-of-age moment for an aspiring idol as she fulfills her promise to bring smiles to those around her.</p> <p><b>Book 3 in this LitRPG Series about an underdog rising up to be the idol her new world didn't know it needed. Hestia may start small, but one day her power will match her determination.</b></p>";
