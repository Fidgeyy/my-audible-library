window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Regan's power grows daily, much to the worry of the ones who are of aware of him. With the influence of Nyx growing like a fire in a dry bed of grass, Regan is attracting more than a little attention from powers that might be beyond him. Never one to back down from a challenge, he might be more than his enemies anticipate. Louella feels like she's living out one of the plays she saw back in the capital. Her private life is a mess, and her lordship is being hounded by more than one person who would like to take her place, in more ways than one. Just how far will the world be able to push her buttons before she starts pushing back, with some lightning in the mix?</p>";
