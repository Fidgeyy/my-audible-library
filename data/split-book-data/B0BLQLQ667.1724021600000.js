She has her own vendetta and practically jumps at the chance to trick Emilia into joining her crew.</p> <p>But when their animosity toward each other blossoms into a passionate romance, the two women will have to decide what they want most.</p> <p>Vengeance?</p> <p>Or love?</p> <p>Contains mature themes.</p>";
