He has found four wives to live within them, but he'll need many more if he wants to fill it with his offspring. To make matters more complicated, more towers like his own have sprung up in the north. The question of who controls them is one he will have to discover before too long...and there are two prisoners within his dungeon cells that have vital information.</p> <p>The question remains: can he give into his darker nature in order to extract this information? The Forgotten Ruler of old would have no objections to using the most effective means of interrogation. If Benjamin wants to step into his new role and become the Forgotten Ruler in truth, he will have to lay aside the moralities of modern Earth and embrace this new world.</p>";
