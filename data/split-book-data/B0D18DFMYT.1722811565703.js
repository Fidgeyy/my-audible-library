window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>Come meet the luckiest guy in Horcross City for this COMPLETE bundle of Incubus RA 1-6 + Imara's Prequel—13 hours more than the previous edition.</p> <p>John Cutter, a human man in a predominantly non-human metropolis, turns out to be not quite as human as he gave himself credit for. His daily life as dorm manager for Mythstone University gets turned upside down when he begins developing strange powers, and before you know it, he's spicily entangled with way too many girls.</p> <p>This series has become a favorite in some circles of the fandom for its ludicrous, over-the-top \"plot\". If you don't mind listening to a hilarious pulp tale for men that jumps the shark at least once every book and has more spice than an Asian grocer, then look no further!</p> <p>All 6 books have been gathered in one place for the first time, plus the prequel novella from Imara's perspective! Get a load of the hour count on this bad boy. What are you waiting for? Buy it. Support Virgil so his wife can keep getting her nails done.</p>";
