window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>Hope. Truth. Redemption.</b></p> <p>The surprise attack on Arkaim has left the Dominion in shambles. Chaos is missing, Asoko is frozen, and an Alliance invasion army over a million strong lands on the shores of the demon nation. Rolan Helt, propped up as the Chosen One and hero of this age by the gods, is placed as the figurehead of this war for extermination as the human army sweeps across the lands almost unhindered.</p> <p>As Lenoly sets out on a perilous but hopeful expedition across the world to free Asoko from her icy prison, Kamii and Daica glimpse the truth about the gods. Hestia and Dregana join the defense of the Dominion, while Rolan wrestles with his growing sense of cognitive dissonance as he participates in the war.</p>";
