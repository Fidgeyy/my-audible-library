window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p><b>[I was reborn too weak to become an adventurer, so I opened an item shop by the dungeon instead!] [Book 4]</b></p> <p>This is it: their final chance at life and happiness.</p> <p>It’s all come to an end. After the events of the east, there’s only one city left where Fresh and her new family can hide from the dangers of the world, desperately clinging to the last hope of normality that the four of them share under the boughs of the great world-tree that hang far over their heads in the central city of the nation. Surrounded on all sides by powerful, high-level adventurers of renown and ancient-blooded nobles, Fresh, Jubilee, Basil, and Shamrock do everything they can to hold their heads down as long as possible, working in secret toward the desires of Fresh’s patron spirit, whom they are not able to disobey, despite the dangers it presents to them all.</p> <p>The Dungeon Item Shop opens its doors one last time in the most dangerous location yet, selling a wide variety of enchanted goods and wares to the unsuspecting people of the protected, regal city that people of the outside world aren’t allowed to enter.</p> <p>Fresh, unable to escape her past any longer—that of her old life and the past of this new one—is torn between her patron’s control over her spirit and her own heart’s desire to live this new, warm life that she’s somehow managed to scrape together despite it. Desperate to keep it safe, together with her new and only family, Fresh is confronted with the heaviness of her actions and must come to a decision regarding her nature as a person.</p> <p>Is such a thing as a happy ending even possible for the four of them after all that has happened, or is the best that they can hope for the ability to desperately cling to one another as they collectively sink into the poisoned world they themselves have helped create?</p> <p>Find out in this wholesome, dark fantasy adventure, the final installment of Dungeon Item Shop, written by renowned and trending author D.M. Rhodes!</p>";
