window.bookSummaryJSON = "<p>The raid did not turn out to be what he was expecting…</p> <p>After some unsettling news brought to them by an unexpected messenger, Prince Edgar fled the Raid Dungeon to hurry back to his kingdom, leaving Derek as the impromptu leader. Being concerned about his people on the outside, Derek chose to rule with an iron fist to finish the dungeon as soon as possible. This choice didn’t make him any friends, but he didn’t need any for it to work.</p> <p>By taking the strongest to battle, he was able to lead the remaining party members to a successful dungeon completion, though, not without casualty. Things are never easy. On their way out of the dungeon, Derek and Silvi were abducted by a strange elf of unknown power. This man, known only as Dave, was strangely helpful and shared much of Derek’s own distaste of the system interference that had been occurring ever since his evolution. Now, with more questions than ever before, and answers to questions that he’d never thought to ask, Derek and Silvi head back to Savannah to lend their help. What has happened to Cydaria? Was Edgar and Lyra leaving the raid the correct decision? Did Cydaria even need the prince’s help? What does dragon taste like when properly cooked?</p> <p>Don’t miss the sixth installment of Derek’s journey in the System Universe. Join Derek in this unique combination of the LitRPG, Isekai, and Slice of Life genres. He has friends, a bond that should last forever, and even a home. What more could our overpowered protagonist ask for?</p>";
